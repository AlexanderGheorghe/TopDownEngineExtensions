Predictive Aim 3D - Ai Action
Add this Ai Action to your enemy AiBrain in replace of AiActionShoot3D to allow your enemy to lead targets.

Make sure your projectile is fast enough to hit your target.  Impossible shots have unpredictable results.  They also do not work with acceleration based projectiles, only linear.
