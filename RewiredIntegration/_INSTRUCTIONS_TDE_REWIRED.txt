Tested with:
- Unity 2021.2.16f1
- More Mountains' TopDown Engine 2.4
- Guavaman Enterprises' Rewired 1.1.41.5.U2021


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Import TopDown Engine (TDE).
2. Import Rewired.
3. Menu item Window > Rewired > Corgi Integration.
4. Import the Unofficial_TDE_Rewired_Integration_YYYY_MM_DD.package.
   I kept class names that include "CorgiEngine" instead of renaming them to 
   TopDownEngine to minimize script changes.
5. Open a TDE scene.
6. Menu item Window > Rewired > Corgi Integration > Create > Rewired Input Manager
   (1-player or 4-player)
7. Menu item Window > Rewired > Create > UI > Rewired Event System.
   Inspect & click Find Rewired Input Manager.
8. Remove KoalaCameras > KoalaUICamera > Input Manager component.
9. Add empty GameObject. Add RewiredCorgiEngineInputManager component. 
   (Add multiple if using local multiplayer, and set Player ID.)
10. Inspect KoalaUICamera > InventoryCanvas.
   - Add RewiredInventoryInputManager; assign the 3 Targets fields.
   - Remove the Inventory Input Manager component.
     Tip: Add the Rewired version first so you know what to assign to Target fields.
     Tip: Included Demo Scene should have things connected for testing.  
     Tip: .json file included can be 'imported' into Rewired -> Tools -> Import Data (in case you need to revert any changes you make in Rewired)
