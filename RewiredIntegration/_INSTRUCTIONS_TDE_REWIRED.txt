Tested with:
- Unity 2019.4
- More Mountains' TopDown Engine 1.8
- Guavaman Enterprises' Rewired 1.1.35.3


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Import TopDown Engine (TDE).
2. Import Rewired.
3. Menu item Window > Rewired > Corgi Integration.
4. Delete RewiredCorgiEngineInputManager.cs and RewiredInventoryInputManager.cs 
   (the scripts reporting compile errors).
5. Import the Unofficial_TDE_Rewired_Integration_YYYY_MM_DD.package.
   I kept class names that include "CorgiEngine" instead of renaming them to 
   TopDownEngine to minimize script changes.
6. Open a TDE scene.
7. Menu item Window > Rewired > Corgi Integration > Create > Rewired Input Manager
   (1-player or 4-player)
8. Menu item Window > Rewired > Create > UI > Rewired Event System.
   Inspect & click Find Rewired Input Manager.
9. Remove KoalaCameras > KoalaUICamera > Input Manager component.
10. Add empty GameObject. Add RewiredCorgiEngineInputManager component. 
   (Add multiple if using local multiplayer, and set Player ID.)
11. Inspect KoalaUICamera > InventoryCanvas.
   - Add RewiredInventoryInputManager; assign the 3 Targets fields.
   - Remove the Inventory Input Manager component.
     Tip: Add the Rewired version first so you know what to assign to Target fields.
